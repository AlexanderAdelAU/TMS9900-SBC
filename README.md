## TMS9900/99105 Single Board Computer

### A bit of history
During my time at university I became caught up in the microprocessor revolution but could not afford many of the available 8 bit microprocessor units that were available at the time, such as the MITS 8080 and the SWTP 6800. With the issue of Ron Cain's Small C compiler in an 1980 issue of Dr Dobbs I began thinking of making my own single board S100 based system. I just knew that it had to be 16 bits and it came down to a choice between the Motorola 68000 and the TI 9900. It was the uniqueness of the TMS900 architecture that set me on the path to building a couple of CPU boards around the TMS900 which eventually led to this single board computer. On this site I will share all the circuit diagrams and software that was built during the whole exercise. I believe this should be readily understandable by anyone who has experience in building electronic systems.
