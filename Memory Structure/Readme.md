### SBC Memory Map
The software memory map is organised as shown in the diagram below.  The TIMON is loaded into ROM at location 0F000H and all other software is loaded into RAM, either by using the TIMON "U (Upload)" command or by using XMODEM applications running on the SBC and the Terminal Application.
